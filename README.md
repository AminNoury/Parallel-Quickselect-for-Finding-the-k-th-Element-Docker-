# Parallel-Quickselect-for-Finding-the-k-th-Element-Docker-
This project implements the Parallel Quickselect algorithm to efficiently find the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array. Instead of running Quickselect sequentially on a single CPU core, the algorithm distributes the partition step across multiple Workers running inside Docker containers, allowing parallel executi
